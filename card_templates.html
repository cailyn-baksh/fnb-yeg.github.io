<!-- The basic building block of both our projects page and our news page is the bootstrap card. -->
<!-- So it is a good idea to read through all of these to get a basic idea of what you can expect to see on
those pages. Feel free to copy/paste these templates into a page of the website where you'd like
to add some content. -->

<!-- Remember that each news item (or project item) must be placed inside its 
	own column, and that each column must be placed within a row
	(A row can have as many columns as you'd like... see the
	bootstrap grid docs for more details) -->

<!-- For help with writing good alt text, I'd recommend googling for tutorials. -->
<!-- But keep in mind that accessibility is very important for any organization, 
	especially any which are concerned with social justice broadly and/or 
	disability justice in particular, and writing good alt text is a very simple
	and basic way to make our website accessible. -->

<!-- Here is a template for a basic news item card with image on top-->
<div class="card">
	<img class="card-img-top" src="path/to/img/source" alt="Briefly describe your image here.
	If it is a poster, transcribe it. ">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="d-flex w-100 justify-content-between">
			<h5 class="mb-1">Title of News Item</h5>
			<small>Date event took place</small>
		</div>
		<p class="mb-1">Description of event.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<!-- Card with header, no image -->
<div class="card">
	<h3 class="card-header">Card Header</h3>
	<div class="card-body">
		<p class="mb-1">Brief description of event or project.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<!-- Card with collapsible transcription -->
<div class="card">
	<img class="card-img-top" src="path/to/img/source" alt="briefly describe your image here
	if it is a poster, transcribe it.">
	<div class="card-body">
		<p>
			<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#templateCollapseTextID" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="templateCollapseTextID">[View Image Transcription]</a>
		</p>
		<div class="collapse" id="templateCollapseTextID">
			<p> Type up the image transcription here.
			<p> Remember that this will be rendered html, so you can use html tags to format the transcription,
				unlike the alt text. Try to keep to basic tags such as <h#>, <p>, etc. 
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<!-- Card with image carousel (static text) -->
<!-- These can be finicky to set up. If you think you did everything right and it's still not working, make sure the page head is correct (matches the head exactly of a page with a working carousel, such as recipes or news.) -->
<div class="card">
	<!-- give your carousel a unique ID and replace every instance of "exampleCarouselID" with your new ID -->
	<!-- data-interval="false" indicates that we do not want the carousel to automatically begin sliding through
		the images. Read the bootstrap carousel docs if you'd like to change this setting. -->
	<div id="exampleCarouselID" class="carousel slide" data-interval="false">
			<!-- First we have the carousel indicators. For each image you'd like to display,
