								Street Outreach YEG
								Street Outreach YEG is a program designed to provide more holistic meals and support to the unhoused community in Edmonton. It is a coalition of Food Not Bombs YEG, Edmonton Mutual Aid, and the Worker's Liberation Coalition. Here are soe of the things we provide to the community. 

								Food!
								The main part of SOY events is a meal. Volunteers from the 3 mentioned organizations have cooked items such as veggie burgers, pasta, and muddings, and also often bring water and fruit. 

								Literature
								Another aspect of SOY events is education. So far we have been focusing on know-your-rights pamphlets so people living rough will be prepared to deal with police should that happen.

								Medical response
								One of the supports that we provide as Street Outreach YEG is emergency medical response; in the event of an opioid overdose, we carry naloxone, and in the case of any other emergency, we have cellphones on us ready to call 911.

								Clothing and companionship
								We are aiming to expand the program by including donations of clothing. Last meal, we gave out nice new messenger bags to unhoused folks at Boyle Street Community Services. In addition, one of the most important things to remember is that unhoused folks are living, breathing people and they need companionship as much as anyone else. Sometimes is brightens someon's day just to receive a hello.
