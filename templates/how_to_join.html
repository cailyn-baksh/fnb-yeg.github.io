		Okay, now that we’ve blown our website-visitor away with all the cool shit we’re involved in, they want to help!! So let’s make that easy for them. I’m thinking “message us” works, but it could also be cool to have a form where they submit contact details & the estimated amount of hours they’d like to contribute? Open to discussion here. Either way, we can set up links here & instructions. & probably detail what kind of work we have available / what sort of time commitment is involved.
