New projects: Uniting the community.

Food Not Bombs YEG, Worker's Liberation Coalition, and Edmonton Mutual Aid are uniting to work on two projects to tie the community together in supporting the houseless population; the Street Outreach Team and Houseless Community Advocacy Council!

Street Outreach
These three allied organizations are working together to make a plan to create a larger, weekly event where we will distribute food, literature, and harm reduction supplies, and check up on our community members to make sure they are safe and well.

Houseless Community Advocacy Council
The HCAC is a new project designed to unite houseless community advocates who are meeting with the city to ensure we present with one voice. We will also discuss closer ties on the ground, such as serving meals together.

Support Local.
If you're interested in supporting any of the three organizations listed or either of the two projects we are working on, check us out on Facebook. We are friendly people and are happy to answer any questions you might have!

Some ways you can help!

We are working hard in the community and we could use some support!

Join our volunteer committees to help us run our community gardens and feed weekly meals to the homeless population on the north side of the city.

If you can't donate financially or volunteer, consider donating other supplies like food from your business or seeds for the garden.

Share our social media content and watch our webinars and podcasts.
