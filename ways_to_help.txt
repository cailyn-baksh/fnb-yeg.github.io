Food Not Bombs YEG
Some ways you can help!

We are working hard in the community and we could use some support!

Join our volunteer committees to help us run our community gardens and feed weekly meals to the homeless population on the north side of the city.

If you can't donate financially or volunteer, consider donating other supplies like food from your business or seeds for the garden.

Share our social media content and watch our webinars and podcasts.
