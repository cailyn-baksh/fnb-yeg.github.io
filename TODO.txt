Note: Flask won't work with GitHub pages, because GitHub pages only supports static sites.
However, we can apparently used Heroku to deploy instead? Apparently it works fairly similarly.
In the meantime, we still can use this repository. See the README.md file for how to set up
a development environment in Flask.

# TODO
- If Heroku is something we want to use, then we'll have to set that up. Otherwise, 
I don't think we can use the jinja2 templating.

- Make navbar links show which page we're on 
(Will have to use toggler classes - see documentation here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/navbar/#nav)

- Refactor templates/template inheritance so that the minimum amount of stuff is on
each template file - we want as much as possible in base.html. That will make it easier
for non-technical, or less-technical people to make edits to a page. 

- Make FNB-YEG a global variable so that the org name isn't hardcoded into the website
