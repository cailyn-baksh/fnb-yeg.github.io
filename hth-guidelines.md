# Helping the Humans Guidelines
## FNB Edmonton 2025

Helping the Humans provides homemade meals. We are unable to provide other forms of assistance at this time. 

Helping the Humans can provide meals a total of four times per family, this is a life-time limit.

**It can take up to a week to receive a meal.**

All meals will be vegan (no meat, fish, dairy, or eggs).

We will do our very best to accommodate dietary limitations. **For allergies, please let us know if cross contamination is a risk.**

If your phone number is out of service, or may be shut off, please give us an alternate way to contact you, such as an email address or friendâ€™s phone number 

If you are unhoused, please choose a location that we can meet you at, like a coffee shop or library. 

All our meals are made by volunteers, please be respectful of their time. **Failure to be at the designated location for meal drop offs may result in cancellation of that meal request.**

If you change locations, this may make it more difficult for the driver and may result in longer wait times to receive a meal. 

You can only have 1 open request at a time. **If you are waiting for a meal and you apply again, you will only receive one meal.**

For families over 10 people, we will do our very best to provide meals to you quickly, but we may need more than 1 week to make that many servings. In rare cases we may only be able to provide 10 servings to families, regardless of the size of the family

Increases in servings needed may result in longer wait times to receive a meal

**We are only able to provide meals within Edmonton city limits.** If you live outside of YEG you can still receive a meal if you meet our volunteers within the city

**Food not Bombs Edmonton has a zero tolerance policy towards bigotry and discrimination. Threats, slurs, and violence against our volunteers is not tolerated and may result in increased wait times, cancellation of meal requests, or removal from the program.**
