									Street Outreach YEG
									Street Outreach YEG is a program designed to provide more holistic meals and support to the unhoused community in Edmonton. It is a coalition of Food Not Bombs YEG, Edmonton Mutual Aid, and the Worker's Liberation Coalition. Here are soe of the things we provide to the community. 

									Food!
									The main part of SOY events is a meal. Volunteers from the 3 mentioned organizations have cooked items such as veggie burgers, pasta, and muddings, and also often bring water and fruit. 

									Literature
									Another aspect of SOY events is education. So far we have been focusing on know-your-rights pamphlets so people living rough will be prepared to deal with police should that happen.

									Medical response
									One of the supports that we provide as Street Outreach YEG is emergency medical response; in the event of an opioid overdose, we carry naloxone, and in the case of any other emergency, we have cellphones on us ready to call 911.

									Clothing and companionship
									We are aiming to expand the program by including donations of clothing. Last meal, we gave out nice new messenger bags to unhoused folks at Boyle Street Community Services. In addition, one of the most important things to remember is that unhoused folks are living, breathing people and they need companionship as much as anyone else. Sometimes is brightens someon's day just to receive a hello.

								<p> When we arrived a few folks were packing up their stuff. We asked what was happening and were told that the tents were in an emergency/service route and the garbage trucks could not get through, so folks would have to move their tents down a block. We stayed down there to keep an eye on the cops. A few of us went to get coffee and donuts, and we handed them out to the people there while keeping an eye on the cops to make sure they didn't start misbehaving. After about an hour, the cops drove away.</p>
								<p> The contrast between the workers, high above, cleaning the windows of a giant office tower, and the unhoused folk below them, was stark. An unspoken threat to the workers above hangs in the air. The threat of being unhoused is not just an idle threat, either. It motivates ordinary workers to endure the indignities and dangers of their workplace. As long as there are some people who live without housing, the price of rent and real estate can be raised. Just as, as long as some people live without jobs, wages can be depressed and benefits can be held back. 
								<p>Those crushed within the margins of the market are subject to every indignity and cruelty to keep them there. Basic sanitation, hot food, clean water, shelter, rest and comfort have been set aside as the privileges of the employed. These can be taken away if workers can't - or won't - endure the smaller indignities and cruelties of the workplace.

New projects: Uniting the community.

Food Not Bombs YEG, Worker's Liberation Coalition, and Edmonton Mutual Aid are uniting to work on two projects to tie the community together in supporting the houseless population; the Street Outreach Team and Houseless Community Advocacy Council!

Street Outreach
These three allied organizations are working together to make a plan to create a larger, weekly event where we will distribute food, literature, and harm reduction supplies, and check up on our community members to make sure they are safe and well.

Houseless Community Advocacy Council
The HCAC is a new project designed to unite houseless community advocates who are meeting with the city to ensure we present with one voice. We will also discuss closer ties on the ground, such as serving meals together.

Support Local.
If you're interested in supporting any of the three organizations listed or either of the two projects we are working on, check us out on Facebook. We are friendly people and are happy to answer any questions you might have!

Some ways you can help!

We are working hard in the community and we could use some support!

Join our volunteer committees to help us run our community gardens and feed weekly meals to the homeless population on the north side of the city.

If you can't donate financially or volunteer, consider donating other supplies like food from your business or seeds for the garden.
